📌 Description

This project demonstrates file handling and error handling in Python.

It asks the user for a filename, reads the content of the file, modifies the text (by converting everything to UPPERCASE), and then saves the modified version into a new file.

If the file does not exist or cannot be read, the program displays a clear error message instead of crashing.

🚀 Features

Read content from an existing file.

Modify the file content (convert to uppercase).

Save the modified content into a new file named modified_<filename>.

Handle errors gracefully (file not found or I/O issues).
